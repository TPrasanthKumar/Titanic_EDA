    "1. **Survival Rates**:\n",
    "   - Females had a significantly higher survival rate (74%) than males (19%), likely due to prioritization during evacuation.\n",
    "   - 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate (63%), followed by 2nd (47%) and 3rd class (24%), indicating socio-economic status played a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demographics**:\n",
    "   - The majority of passengers were young adults (20-30 years), with fewer children and elderly.\n",
    "   - Age alone was not a strong predictor of survival, though younger passengers slightly outnumbered older survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic Factors**:\n",
    "   - Higher fares were associated with survival, likely because they corresponded to 1st class tickets.\n",
    "   - The fare distribution was highly skewed, with a few passengers paying significantly more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relationships**:\n",
    "   - `Pclass` and `Fare` showed the strongest relationships with survival.\n",
    "   - No strong correlation between `Age` and other variables, but `Pclass` and `Fare` were moderately correlated (-0.55).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Quality**:\n",
    "   - Missing values in `Age` and `Embarked` were handled appropriately.\n",
    "   - `Cabin` was dropped due to excessive missing data, which may limit analysis of cabin location effects.\n"
